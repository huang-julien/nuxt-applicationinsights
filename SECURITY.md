## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please [privately report it via the Security tab](https://github.com/huang-julien/nuxt-applicationinsights/security/advisories/new) on the correct GitHub repository (see [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)). If that is impossible, feel free to send an email to **julien.h.dev@gmail.com** instead.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed. 

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, it is recommended to use the latest versions of dependencies by maintaining lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`) in order to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
